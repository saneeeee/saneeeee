                <ul>
                    <li>After noticing extremely high PC and console game prices in Turkey, 
                        co-found a <a href="oyuncuzdanim.com">website</a> where we bought digital games that people had already finished 
                        and resold/traded them to new customers who had not played them yet.</li>
                    <li>Designed and implemented an automated delivery program that would receive the orders 
                        via our online shopping platform providers API and fulfill the or- ders automatically by sending keys 
                        and activation instructions to buyers email address.</li>

                    <li>Designed and implemented a program to detects faces in videos/live feeds and
                        detect if a face is wearing a face mask.</li>
                    <li>Researched various convolutional neural network architectures and
                         decided to train my own MobileNetV2 using Keras and Tensorflow.</li>
                    <li>Found and pre-processed masked and unmasked training and validation data sets. 
                        Experimented with training parameters to obtain the best model from my data.</li>
                    <li>Tested my model, and wrote my observations as an article. Emailed my article to technology writers from 
                        Turkish newspapers, and was featured in the biggest national newspaper 
                        (the article) and many other technology websites.</li>

                    <li>Transformed a drone that I received as a gift to an autonomous cargo delivery 
                        drone that could navigate to a drop-off location, perform receiver validation,
                        and deliver cargo.</li>
                    <li>Implemented a control station program to perform Google Maps API search on 
                        an address and parse the returned JSON file to retrieve coordinates of 
                        the delivery point and generate a transaction specific hash.</li>
                    <li>Used the drone's GPS module and SDK to autonomously navigate to the received drop off 
                        coordinates and hover above the ground to perform delivery.</li>
                    <li>Utilized the drones front facing camera to match a QR code sent to the customer with the generated 
                        hash to validate that the person receiving the delivery is the correct customer.</li>
                    <li>Attended a Hackathon competition organized by Mentorloops (based in San Francisco/ Istanbul)
                         under the category of Aerospace and won first place.</li>
